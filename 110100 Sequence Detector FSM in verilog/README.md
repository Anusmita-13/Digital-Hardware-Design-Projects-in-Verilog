This project implements a Moore FSM–based sequence detector in Verilog HDL.
The design uses a synchronous clocked FSM with active-high reset.
Output is asserted only when the FSM reaches the final detection state.
Simulation and verification are performed using EDA Playground (EPWave).
A waveform screenshot is included to demonstrate correct FSM operation.
